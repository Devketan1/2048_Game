# 2048_Game
So, Here's a game 2048, built using python and tkinter. Currently, this game has some issues in the ending part i.e. when the game is about to be over, the system hangs up and closes the python running in background. Ignoring that, the game seems working Fine! I hope someone will do look and rectify the error the game has.
